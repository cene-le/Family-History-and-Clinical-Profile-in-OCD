# EDA : Family-History-and-Clinical-Profile-in-OCD

In an effort to hone my skills in the field of data visualization, this time I conducted an experiment using the 'OCD Patient Dataset: Demographics & Clinical Data' available on Kaggle. The primary focus this time is to explore the extent to which family history contributes to the manifestation and severity of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) symptoms.

# Methodology

# Insight
The visualization depicting the spread and distribution of scores on the Y-BOCS scale among patients with and without a family history of OCD can be observed in the boxplot below. This can help to understand whether there are significant differences in the severity of obsessions and compulsions between the two groups ('Yes': 1, 'No': 0).

Based on the box plot visualization for obsession and compulsion scores, we can observe that the median, mean, and standard deviation of scores on the Y-BOCS scale do not show significant differences between patients with and without a family history of OCD. For obsession scores, the median of the 'Yes' and 'No' groups is almost the same. Similarly, for compulsion scores, the median of both groups is also similar.

In this case, a correlation value close to zero (very small) indicates that there is no significant correlation between those variables. This suggests that, **'at least based on this analysis, there is not a strong basis to conclude that a family history significantly influences the severity of obsessions and compulsions in OCD patients'**.

However, it's important to note that these are results from a specific dataset, and their interpretation should be considered in the clinical context and scientific wisdom. If there are additional factors that could potentially influence the results, they should be taken into account in further analysis.
